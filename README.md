foundry
=======
Foundry is a PHP framework that uses Foundry design pattern desgined and introduced by Darley Stephen.
unlike MVC or anyother similar patterns, Foundry pattern is more authentic and easy to integrate. 

Foundry PHP was tested under Development , Stage and Production environment of both simple and high resource intensive applications, Foundry PHP proved to be 75% faster than any of the existing PHP Frameworks like Zend, CakePHP , Symfony.


Start writing your code under Casts and Molds. The Structure of Foundry is simple, it has the core Foundry libraries and a foundryWEB01 directory that is used for you to write your application. Molds are basically  creating a Mold of your custom events, Functions, data access, transactions and integrations. which can be used directly or by the means of Casts, Cast is a place where you write your custom code that uses Mold/Modls and allows users to directly use it.

Calling Casts:
 Example : 1. http://localhost/getImages@cast_first
 Example : 2. http://localhost/funcCall(getImages)@cast_first
